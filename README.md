# Project 13 Front End Developer ARGENTBANK OpenClassrooms

## Title : Use an API for a bank user account with React

## Mission

The project is about a new start-up bank, Argent Bank, which is trying to break into the industry and needs help setting up its app. We obtained a two-part contract which is broken down into several phases:
- Phase 1: User Authentication - Creation of a web application allowing customers to log in and manage their accounts and profile.
- Phase 2: Transactions - This would be to specify the API endpoints needed for a possible second mission once we have completed the first.

## Assignmenet

Create the complete and responsive web application with React. As a starting point, we have provided you with static HTML and CSS for the home page, login page, and profile page.
Use Redux to manage the state of the entire application.
What the app should do (see details for each on our GitHub Issues templates):
User can visit homepage
User can login to the system
User can log out of the system
User can only see their own profile information after successfully logging in
The user can modify the profile and keep the data in the database.
